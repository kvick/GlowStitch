# GlowStitch LEDs
The most versatile way to add lights to wearable tech and crafting projects.

#What are GlowStitch LEDs?
GlowStitch LEDs are flexible, paintable, machine sewable, hand sewable, and colorful LED lights. Perfect for hobbyists, makers, cosplayers, and teachers, they are the ultimate all-in-one crafting product for soft circuits, paper circuits, and so much more. Made from flexible PCBs, they are the most versatile way to get started with electronics and crafting projects.  All you need is some conductive fabric tape and a battery holder to make a circuit.

These will be launched as a project with [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/makerqueenau/glowstitch-leds) very soon, where you can read full details on the project.  

The Build process has been documented on the [Hackaday Project page.](https://hackaday.io/project/186907-machine-sewable-led-strips)

# Why Open Source? 
The aim of this project is to make electronics easier and strip away the things that make it hard.  Releasing the circuit board designs makes it easier for others to get involved and design their own compatible modules, building up a larger variety of GlowStitch parts.  The faster we can work, the more things we’ll build and the better we’ll get at things like innovating in wearable tech and edutech spaces.  
I encourage you to download these blueprints and design your own modules for custom projects, interesting applications, and commercial products.  This will enable the creation of much larger custom projects where you might require more specific LED colours for group projects, art installations, conference badges and much more.  By doing this I will be delighted to know that you are inspiring and educating others and maybe even learning some circuit board design skills yourself.

Whatever you make, I’d prefer if you labelled it with the project name ‘GlowStitch’ as attribution to the project.  Please note the variety sheets with space artwork showcased on the Crowd Supply campaign will not be available here.  

# Tech Specs
As well as the editable working files in KiCAD, I’ve also included the gerber files for each of these which enable you to send these directly to the factory of your choice.  Soon they will also be available through PCBWay’s module store if you’d prefer to just click the purchase button.  
All the LEDs used are 0807 size, about half the size of a grain of rice.  If you are planning to hand-solder these in your own run of LED strips, make sure to get yourself some proper SMD (surface mount) soldering equipment rather than using a large soldering iron. This includes a reflow plate, reflow oven or hot air reflow station, plus solder paste and a good pair of tweezers. 
The tabs on the LED strips are designed for 8mm size fabric conductive tape. 

# Manufacturing Specs
To get the gerber files manufactured, you’ll also need to specify these manufacturing details as well as the panel size detailed in the file descriptions. 
- 1 Layer
- Black Soldermask / Coverlay
- White Silkscreen
- ENIG finish
- Polymide Flex material, 0.1mm thickness
- No stiffener
